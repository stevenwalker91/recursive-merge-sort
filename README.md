# recursive-merge-sort

Recursive function which takes an unordered array and uses merge sort algorithm to sort the list from smallest to largest. 

The function recursively calls itself to "divide and conquer", splitting the list in half until only one value remains. It then works it's way back up the tree, merging each list with a corresponding 'neighbour' list based on smallest to highest value.
